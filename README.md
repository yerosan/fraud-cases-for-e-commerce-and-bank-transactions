# Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Bank Transactions
## Repository: Fraud Cases for E-Commerce and Bank Transactions

### Project Overview
This project focuses on improving the detection of fraudulent activities in e-commerce and bank transactions. By leveraging machine learning and advanced data analysis, I aim to build robust models that detect fraud with high accuracy. The project uses transaction data, geolocation analysis, and time-based features to improve fraud detection and enhance security for financial systems.

### Objective
- Detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Provide actionable insights for businesses to mitigate risks.
- Ensure continuous monitoring and model improvement.

### Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing
#### Steps Completed:
**Data Cleaning:**
- Handled missing values and removed duplicates.
- Corrected data types for proper analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
**Key Insights:**
- Class Imbalance: The majority of transactions are non-fraudulent, indicating a need for balancing techniques.
- High-Value Transactions: Fraud cases are more common for higher purchase amounts.
- Browser Analysis: Browsers like Opera and IE exhibit higher fraud rates.
- Age Factor: Younger users show a higher likelihood of involvement in fraudulent activities.
- Time-Based Fraud: Fraud cases occur more frequently outside regular business hours.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Created transaction frequency, velocity, and time-based features.
- Prepared datasets for geolocation analysis using IP mapping.

#### Next Steps:
- Build and train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Incorporate model explainability (using SHAP and LIME).
- Deploy the models with a Flask API and build a fraud monitoring dashboard using Dash.
